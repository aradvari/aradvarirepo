But to make things clear we need to go back in time……back to May 2007 for that is the month Zoneshop began to operate. It might not have been the first web-shop in its category but it certainly set the bar high concerning online sales. Following two years of warm-up we stepped to the next level by establishing Coreshop in November 2009. From that time our activities were solely focused on web-sales and our main goal has become setting a high quality standard without compromising in looks, portfolio or customer service. Thousands of satisfied customers from past years and a huge number of positive feedbacks prove that we are doing it right.But why stop here? Early 2013 will be marked as a new milestone in the history of Coreshop: the look of the site will be re-designed, not only will it be more up-to-date but transparent and user friendly as well. One of the biggest advantages of online sales is that orders can be entered anywhere in front of a computer screen. So far “anywhere” meant only the territory of Hungary. So far; because from now on coreshop.hu goes English (and Hungarian), prices are shown in both HUF and EUR, and orders may be placed from literally anywhere inside the EU. Our contracted courier services make sure goods are delivered in the shortest possible time, at a reasonable cost.Of course there are many who do not check online stores` sites on a daily basis, but hang out on Facebook quite often. We have good news to these people: the same time Coreshop goes international, its Facebook-store will become operational as well. This is not just a site for recommending products but an up-to-date Facebook-version of the actual online store. <a href="http://facebook.com/coreshop" target="_blank">facebook.com/coreshop</a>All we need to get these things started is a high inventory level. But there is no need to wait for long, because the spring collections of our brands are ready to be delivered from factories to store shelves. You will be informed first hand on each new arrival, until that time please check out the renewed site, we hope you like it. '.$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'].'We hope to welcome you in the new Coreshop in 2013 as well.<i style="color:#0088e3;">CoreTeam</i>')*/?></p></div>
